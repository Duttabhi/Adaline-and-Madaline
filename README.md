# Basic-Neural-Nets
Simple Neural Net like Adaline/Madaline codes (Python) similar to what taught in 8th semester the Computer Science Department, NIT Raipur.
# Steps
Just update the input array x, weight array w and target t and get the desired result in the form of dataframe table.
# Assumptions
According to the algorithm in Introduction to Neural Networks Using Matlab 6.0, S. N. Sivanandam, S. N Deepa book
